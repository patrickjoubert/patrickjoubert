## What I'm building

[Rippletide](https://www.rippletide.com) is the **decision context graph** for enterprise AI agents. We sit between the LLM and the real world — every agent action is validated against structured rules and verified data before it executes. Deterministic. Auditable. Enforceable.

The LLM proposes. Rippletide decides.

## Things I think about

- Why **[95% accuracy will fail in production](https://www.rippletide.com/resources/blog/autonomous-ai-enterprise)** — and what to do about it
- Moving from AI outputs to **[AI outcomes](https://www.rippletide.com/resources/blog/winning-the-openai-codex-hackathon-moving-from-outputs-to-outcomes-the-decision-layer)** (we won the OpenAI Codex Hackathon building this)
- What **[context graphs actually solve](https://www.rippletide.com/resources/blog/rippletide-blaxel-safe-enterprise-agents-at-real-time-speed)** for agent reliability
- The **[real failure modes](https://www.rippletide.com/resources/blog/what-can-go-wrong-with-agents-in-production)** when agents hit production

## Open to collaborating on

- **AI agents** for enterprise workflows where reliability is non-negotiable
- **Neuro-symbolic reasoning** and evaluation frameworks for agents
- Product-led **B2B software** that ships fast and scales
- **Developer experience** and tooling that removes friction

## Principles

**Clarity over cleverness** · **Reliability over hype** · **Speed with standards**
